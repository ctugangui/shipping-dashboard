# Task: Fix Kanban Status Mapping

**Context:** A package with the UPS status "TRANSIT" is currently showing up in the "Processing / Shipped" column. It should be in the "In Transit" column.
**Goal:** Update the grouping logic to be more inclusive of common carrier status strings.

# Requirements

## 1. Update Grouping Logic
* **File:** `src/controllers/ViewController.ts`
* **Action:** Find the logic that filters shipments into `processing`, `inTransit`, and `delivered`.
* **Fix:** Update the `inTransit` filter to include the string `"TRANSIT"`.
    * *Better approach:* Use `.toUpperCase()` and check for keywords.
    * **In Transit** should now include: `IN_TRANSIT`, `TRANSIT`, `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`, `SHIPPED`.
    * **Delivered** should include: `DELIVERED`.
    * **Processing** remains the fallback for everything else (e.g., `LABEL_CREATED`, `PENDING`, `UNKNOWN`).

## 2. Dynamic Column Counters (Optional but Recommended)
* **File:** `src/views/index.ejs`
* **Action:** Ensure the little number badges in the column headers correctly reflect the count of the arrays (`processing.length`, etc.) so the UI stays in sync.

# Verification
1. Run the build to ensure no TypeScript errors.
2. Load the dashboard. Your UPS package with status "TRANSIT" should now automatically appear in the middle **In Transit** column.
